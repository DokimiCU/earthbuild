# Earthbuild, by Dokimi

Current version: 1.0.2

A mod for minetest that adds traditional dirt and vegetation based construction methods and technologies, which do not require the use of quarrying or mining.


# Instructions:
This mod aims to realistically capture these building techniques. Therefore it contains a mechanism which will degrade most earthen blocks to dirt if they are in contact with soil or water. This reflects the real world importance of keeping these materials dry. Make sure dirt based blocks (e.g. "Rammed Earth", "Cob" etc) are placed on foundations above the soil, or whitewashed.

Each material has different pros and cons. Explore!

Turf can only be aquired using the turf cutting tool on dirt with grass (to get the grass), or dirt with snow (it's a cold climate method).

Compacted dirt can only be made using the dirt compactor. This is to simulate bare ground that has been cleared of vegetation but little else.

# What are all these things?
- Cob: an ancient building material of straw and mud.
- Mud brick: cob shaped into bricks and dried.
- Rammed Earth: an ancient building technique of compressing earth into thick walls.
- Wattle and daub: woven sticks (the wattle), covered by daub (cob or something similar).
- Thatch: an ancient roofing method. Thick bundles of vegetation.
- Whitewash: a protective coating made from limestone. A little chemistry is used to turn it into a paint-like paste.
- Turf: soil held together by deep grass roots. Used to make thick insulating walls in places like Iceland.
- Drystack: Walls made from found stones (e.g. from clearing a field), stacked. Typically used for farm fences.
- Straw-bale walls: Bales of straw covered in cob (or similar). Historically used on farms with lots of excess straw.
- Bottle gourd: a pumpkin-like plant. The hollowed out fruits have long been used as storage vessels, bowls, etc.
- Fire sticks: the difficult task of rubbing two sticks together to start a fire via friction.
